This Solidity smart contract, named LostAndFound, manages the reporting and tracking of lost smartphones on the blockchain. It utilizes a struct Smartphone to store details such as owner 
address, brand, model, color, and a boolean flag indicating if the smartphone has been found. Key components include:

Struct Definition: Defines the Smartphone struct with relevant details.

Mapping: Uses a mapping (smartphones) to associate each smartphone ID with its corresponding Smartphone struct.

State Variables:

nextId: Tracks the ID for the next smartphone to be reported, ensuring each smartphone has a unique identifier.
Events:

SmartphoneReported: Emits when a smartphone is reported as lost, capturing ID, owner address, brand, model, and color.
SmartphoneFound: Emits when a smartphone is marked as found, indicating the ID of the smartphone found.
Functions:

reportSmartphone: Allows users to report a smartphone as lost, validating inputs and storing details in the mapping.
findSmartphone: Enables users to mark a reported smartphone as found, updating its status in the mapping.
Modifiers and Error Handling: Uses require statements to validate inputs and states (e.g., ensuring smartphone details are not empty, checking existence and found status of smartphones).

Fallback and Receive Functions: Implements fallback and receive functions to handle invalid transactions and reject incoming Ether, respectively.
